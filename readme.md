# 🤖 ChatUniTest - A framework for LLM based test generation

This repository contains our research review and presentation on the **ChatUniTest** framework — a tool designed to automatically generate unit tests using Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-based models. The study evaluates the framework's performance, design, and limitations in the context of software testing automation.

## 🎯 Summary of Research Goals

The primary goal of the research was to:
- Understand and analyze the effectiveness of ChatUniTest for automated test generation.
- Evaluate the integration of LLMs into the software testing lifecycle.
- Identify the strengths and limitations of relying on models like ChatGPT for generating meaningful unit test cases.

## 🔍 Key Contributions

- Reviewed the **ChatUniTest** framework's approach, architecture, and use of prompt engineering.
- Analyzed experimental results comparing GPT-3.5-generated tests to human-written ones.
- Identified critical challenges such as hallucination, coverage gaps, and maintainability of generated tests.
- Proposed **future research directions** like fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks and enhancing prompt robustness.
- Developed and delivered a professional presentation summarizing the research.
